  EthernetUdp.h

  Ethernet_Generic is a library for the W5x00 Ethernet shields trying to merge the good features of
  previous Ethernet libraries
  
  Based on and modified from 
  
  1) Ethernet Library         https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Ethernet
  2) EthernetLarge Library    https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/EthernetLarge
  3) Ethernet2 Library        https://github.com/adafruit/Ethernet2
  4) Ethernet3 Library        https://github.com/sstaub/Ethernet3
    
  Built by Khoi Hoang https://github.com/khoih-prog/EthernetWebServer
  
  Version: 2.6.0

/*
 *  Udp.cpp: Library to send/receive UDP packets with the Arduino ethernet shield.
 *  This version only offers minimal wrapping of socket.cpp
 *  Drop Udp.h/.cpp into the Ethernet library directory at hardware/libraries/Ethernet/
 *
 * NOTE: UDP is fast, but has some important limitations (thanks to Warren Gray for mentioning these)
 * 1) UDP does not guarantee the order in which assembled UDP packets are received. This
 * might not happen often in practice, but in larger network topologies, a UDP
 * packet can be received out of sequence.
 * 2) UDP does not guard against lost packets - so packets *can* disappear without the sender being
 * aware of it. Again, this may not be a concern in practice on small local networks.
